  @p
    Ammonite is a project by @lnk("Li Haoyi", "http://www.lihaoyi.com/"). If
    you use Ammonite and enjoyed it, please chip in to support our development
    at:

  @ul
    @li
      @lnk("https://www.patreon.com/lihaoyi", "https://www.patreon.com/lihaoyi")


  @p
    Any amount will help us develop Ammonite into the best possible REPL and
    script runner for the Scala community!

  @p
    The goal of Ammonite is to liberate your Scala code from heavyweight
    "projects", using the lightweight Ammonite runtime: if you want to run some
    Scala, open the @sect.ref{Ammonite-REPL} and run it, interactively! If you
    want to run it later, save it into some @sect.ref{Scala Scripts} and run
    those later.

  @p
    For a video overview of the project and it's motivation, check out this talk:

  @iframe(
    src := "https://player.vimeo.com/video/148552858",
    width := 800,
    height := 600,
    attr("frameborder") := 0,
    attr("webkitallowfullscreen") := 1,
    attr("mozallowfullscreen") := 1,
    attr("allowfullscreen") := 1
  )
  @p
    If you are already working in Scala,
    you no longer have to drop down to Python or Bash for your scripting needs:
    you can use @sect.ref{Scala Scripts} for your scripting needs, and avoid
    the overhead of working in multiple languages.

  @p
    Each of the above projects is usable standalone; click on the links to jump
    straight to their docs, or scroll around and browse through the navigation
    bar on the left. If you're wondering what you can do @i{with} Ammonite,
    there is an

  @ul
    @li
      @sect.ref{Ammonite Cookbook}

  @p
    Which contains a bunch of fun things that you can do, whether in the
    interactive @sect.ref{Ammonite-REPL} or in some @sect.ref{Scala Scripts}.
    You can also take a look at how people are using Ammonite in the wild:

  @ul
    @li
      @sect.ref{In the Wild}

    To see what people are doing with it. And there are more talks available
    below:

  @p
    The bulk of this page describes the latest stable release of Ammonite,
    @code{@ammonite.Constants.version}. If you're willing to live on the edge,
    we also publish @sect.ref{Unstable Versions} from any commits that get pushed
    or pull-requests that land in the master branch:
