        The **Ammonite-REPL** is an improved Scala REPL, re-implemented from first principles.
        It is much more featureful than the default REPL and comes
          with a lot of [ergonomic improvements](${featuresSection.ref})
          and [configurability](${configurationSection.ref}) that may be familiar to
          people coming from IDEs or other REPLs such as
          [IPython](https://ipython.org/) or [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/).

        It can be combined with [Ammonite-Ops](${AmmoniteOps.ref}) 
          to replace Bash as your systems shell,
          but can also be used alone as a 
          [superior](${featuresSection.ref}) version of the default Scala REPL,
          or as a [debugging tool](${debuggingSection.ref}), or for many other
          [fun and interesting things](${AmmoniteCookbook.ref})!

        If you want to use Ammonite as a plain Scala shell, download the standalone
          Ammonite ${Constants.version} executable for Scala 2.12
          (also available for [Older Scala Versions](${Reference.olderScalaVersionsSection.ref})):

         [Features](${featuresSection.ref})!
      
        If you're not sure what to do with Ammonite, 
          check out the [Ammonite Cookbook](${AmmoniteCookbook.ref}) for some fun ideas!
      
        If you want to use Ammonite as a filesystem shell, 
          take a look at [Ammonite Shell](${AmmoniteShell.ref}).
          
        If you want some initialization code available to the REPL, you can add
          it to your `~/.ammonite/predef.sc`.
          
        If you have any questions, come hang out on the 
           [mailing list or gitter channel](${Reference.communitySection.ref}) and get help!
