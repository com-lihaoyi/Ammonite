      // computation is side-effecting, is indeed serialized along `closure`,
      // rather than re-computed.

      // About the issue of values in singletons not being serialized (and
      // being recomputed if necessary), see the discussion in
      // https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-internals/h27CFLoJXjE.

      // This is similar to what happens when mapping a function on an RDD
      // or using a UDF in Spark: a closure gets serialized this way, and is sent
      // to a bunch of "executors" that each deserialize it.

      // In the test, `a` acts as the result of the heavy computation. We do not want
      // the calculation of `a` to re-run when deserializing `closure`.

      // After creating the closure, the test serializes it, then deserializes it
      // via a classloader that can load the exact same bytecode as the classloader of
      // the current session. We call the deserialized closure by reflection, and check
      // that the heavy computation was not run again.

      // -Ydelambdafy=inline seems to be required in 2.12 for serializing lambdas
