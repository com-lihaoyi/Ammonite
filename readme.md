# Ammonite [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lihaoyi/Ammonite.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lihaoyi/Ammonite) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/lihaoyi/Ammonite](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/lihaoyi/Ammonite?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is where the code for the [Ammonite](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite) project lives; Both:

- [Ammonite-REPL](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite), the improved Scala REPL
- [Ammonite-Ops](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-Ops), the Scala file-system library

If you want to learn more about Ammonite or how to use it, check out the links above, or ask on the [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/lihaoyi/Ammonite). The remainder of this document is developer-docs for people who want to work on the Ammonite source code itself.

# Developer Docs

The layout of the repository is roughly:

- `ops/` is [Ammonite-Ops](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-Ops)
- `repl/` is [Ammonite-REPL](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite)
- `terminal/` is the JLine re-implementation used by Ammonite-REPL to provide syntax highlighting and multiline editing
- `tools/` is a WIP implementation of common shell utilities in Scala; currently not used nor documented
- `readme/` is the source code for the [Documentation](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-Ops), written in [Scalatex](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Scalatex/).

## Common Commands

- `sbt ~repl/run` brings up the Ammonite-REPL using the source code in the repository, and automatically restarts it on-exit if you have made a change to the code. Useful for manual testing both of `repl/` as well as `ops/`, since you can just `import ammonite.ops._` and start using them.
- `sbt ~terminal/run` is useful for manual testing the terminal interaction; it basically contains a minimal echo-anything terminal, with multiline input based on the count of open- and closed-parentheses. This lets you test all terminal interactions without all the complexity of the Scala compiler, classloaders, etc. that comes in `repl/`
- `sbt ~repl/test`/`sbt ~ops/test`/`sbt ~terminal/test`  runs tests after every change. `repl/test` can be a bit slow because of the amount of code it compiles, so you may want to specify the test manually via `repl/test-only -- ammonite.repl.TestObject.path.to.test`
- `sbt +publishLocal` or `+sbt publishSigned` is used for publishing.
- `sbt ~readme/run` builds the documentation inside its target folder, which you can view by opening `readme/target/scalatex/index.html` in your browser.
- `git checkout gh-pages; cp -r readme/target/scalatex.* .; git commit -am .; git push` will deploy the generated documentation to Github Pages

## Contribution Guidelines

- **All code PRs should come with**: a meaningful description, inline-comments for important things, unit tests (positive and negative), and a green build in [CI](https://travis-ci.org/lihaoyi/Ammonite)
- **PRs for features should generally come with *something* added to the [Documentation](lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite)**, so people can discover that it exists
- **Be prepared to discuss/argue-for your changes if you want them merged**! You will probably need to refactor so your changes fit into the larger codebase
- **If your code is hard to unit test, and you don't want to unit test it, that's ok**. But be prepared to argue why that's the case!
- **It's entirely possible your changes won't be merged**, or will get ripped out later. This is also the case for my changes, as the Author!
- **Even a rejected/reverted PR is valuable**! It helps explore the solution space, and know what works and what doesn't. For every line in the repo, at least three lines were tried, committed, and reverted/refactored, and more than 10 were tried without committing.
- **Feel free to send Proof-Of-Concept PRs** that you don't intend to get merged.
